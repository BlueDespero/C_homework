# C coding for C classes

1. Description

    In this repository you will find all my solutions to problems presented to students of the University of Wroclaw during C classes.

2. Purpose

    The sole purpose of this repository is to make it easier for me to keep track of my assignments. Because I switch computers often it is easier for me to commit any progress to a single storage.

3. Disclaimer

    Every piece of code in this repository is of my authorship. I am not aware of any University rule I would be breaking by keeping my code in the public repository. I do not mind others looking into my code. I hope that the solutions found here may act as hints for others while coming up with ones on their own.
